    },
    {
      question: "Why is Zakat important in Islam?",
      answer: "Zakat purifies your wealth, benefits those in need, and promotes social justice.",
      reference: "\"Take from their wealth a charity (Zakat) to cleanse and purify them.\" (Quran 9:103)\n\n\"Charity (Zakat) does not decrease wealth.\" (Sahih Muslim, 2588)"
    },
    {
      question: "Who must pay Zakat?",
      answer: "Any adult Muslim who owns wealth above Nisab for a full lunar year.",

    },
    {
      question: "What is Nisab, and how do I determine it?",
      answer: "Nisab is the minimum wealth threshold for Zakat, equal to 85 grams gold or 595 grams silver.",
      reference: "Hadith-based consensus: Nisab equals the Prophet's standard (85g gold or 595g silver)."

      reference: "Prophet's Sunnah: The agreed-upon standard is 2.5% (Ijma of scholars)."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I pay Zakat on my RRSP?",
      answer: "It depends. Zakat applies only to funds you can access immediately (after taxes or penalties). If your RRSP is locked, you don't pay Zakat on it now. But when you withdraw, pay Zakat on the withdrawn amount for that year.",
      reference: "Fatwa councils such as AMJA, Islamic Fiqh Academy"
    },
    {
      question: "Is my house or personal car subject to Zakat?",

    },
    {
      question: "Do I pay Zakat on jewelry?",

      reference: "Fatwa by multiple Islamic councils and scholars."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I subtract debts from my Zakat calculation?",
      answer: "Yes. Immediate debts due this year are subtracted.",
      reference: "Consensus of jurists â€“ Hanafi, Shafi'i, Maliki, Hanbali"
    },
    {
      question: "Can long-term debts like mortgages be deducted?",
      answer: "Only the portion payable immediately (current year's installment).",
      reference: "Islamic Fiqh Academy resolution"
    },
    {
      question: "What if I missed paying Zakat in past years?",
      answer: "Calculate immediately and pay missed Zakat. Seek forgiveness.",
      reference: "\"The debt of Allah deserves to be paid most.\" (Sahih Bukhari, 1953)"
    },
    {
      question: "Who is eligible to receive Zakat?",

    },
    {
      question: "Can I pay Zakat to my relatives?",
      answer: "Yes, except to immediate dependents (parents, spouse, children).",

    },
    {
      question: "Can Zakat be given to non-Muslims?",
      answer: "No. Zakat must be given to Muslims, but charity (Sadaqah) can be given to anyone.",
      reference: "Scholarly consensus based on Quran 9:60"
